6,Thomas Höllt,Tuesday,17:00,18:00,TU Delft,,Theme: Single-cell data and dimensionality reduction techniques,"Thomas Höllt is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Graphics and Visualization Group (CGV) at Delft University of Technology. Before that, he was Assistant Professor in the Leiden Computational Biology Center (LCBC) at the Leiden University Medical Center. He has been awarded the Dirk Bartz Prize for Visual Computing in Medicine in 2019 and the third prize in 2021 for his work on visual analytics approaches in (spatial) single-cell analysis. In 2023, he was awarded the VRVis Visual Computing award for sustainable development for his work on Cytosplore. His research interests include visualization and visual analytics for high-dimensional data, with a focus on biomedical applications, in particular, applications using -omics data.",hollt.jpg,,,
7,Laura Garrison,Wednesday,09:00,10:30,University of Bergen,lauragarrison87@gmail.com,Crash-Course in Creating Biomedical Graphics (Workshop),"Laura Garrison is a visualization researcher and biomedical illustrator currently affiliated with Bouvet ASA and the Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway. She received her PhD in Visualization from the University of Bergen for her work on multiscale visualization of human physiology for discovery and communication. She is a recipient of the Karl-Heinz Höhne (MedVis) Award (2021) and the Dirk Bartz Prize this year. Prior to her PhD, she worked as an artist and content director in medical education technology start-ups in Chicago, Silicon Valley, and New York City. She is passionate about combining art, science, and technology to ask better questions and share stories about data, particularly for the life sciences.",garrison.jpg,,,"In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn theory and techniques to visually communicate your science to a wide range of audiences. Although this tutorial focuses primarily on biomedical communication, the content from this tutorial is broadly applicable to other areas. We will cover principles of graphic design, and how to apply these principles in practice to create graphical abstracts, scientific figures, research posters, and outreach material that illustrate your research. You will receive a crash-course in illustration and layout using Figma, a popular cloud-based application in the design industry. Working from either some sample datasets or from your own research, we will work through the complete design pipeline, beginning with sketching and ideation on through a final result."
